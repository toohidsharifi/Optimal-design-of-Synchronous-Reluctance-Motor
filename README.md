Optimal Design of a Synchronous Reluctance Motor Using BioGeography-Based Optimization
High torque density is a demanding criterion in electrical machines. Machines with permanent magnets (PM) in their structure possess this feature inherently. On the other hand, in motors with no PM material, torque density is a source of concern for machine designers. So, the optimization methods should be used in the design process to achieve the best performance in terms of torque density. Biogeography-based optimization (BBO) is a relatively new algorithm with good convergence in the least time. In this project, the structure of a synchronous reluctance (SyncRel) motor with no PM material is optimized using the BBO method.
